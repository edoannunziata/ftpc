# ftpc

ftpc is a simple TUI file transfer client that supports multiple storage backends.
It is designed to be simple and hackable, and doubles as a quick-and-dirty library
to access the storage backends programmatically.

A substantial part of the development was assisted by artificial intelligence tools,
and the projects doubles as a training ground to see how far these tools can be pushed.

## Supported backends
- Local filesystem
- FTP/FTPS with TLS support
- SFTP 
- S3 compatible
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

## Installation

### Basic Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Full Installation (all backends)
```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Installing Specific Backends

For Azure support:
```bash
pip install azure-storage-file-datalake azure-identity
```

For AWS S3 support:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

For SFTP support:
```bash
pip install paramiko
```

## Configuration

FTPC uses a TOML configuration file to manage connection details. By default, it looks for `~/.ftpcconf.toml`.

### Configuration Options

Each remote connection is defined as a section in the TOML file with a `type` field specifying the storage backend.

#### Local Client

```toml
[local]
type = "local"
# No additional configuration needed for local file access
```

#### FTP Client

```toml
[ftp]
type = "ftp"
url = "ftp://ftp.example.com"       # Required: FTP server URL
username = "user"                   # Optional: Username (default: "anonymous")
password = "password"               # Optional: Password (default: "anonymous@")
tls = false                         # Optional: Enable TLS/SSL (default: false)
```

#### SFTP Client

```toml
[sftp]
type = "sftp"
url = "sftp.example.com"            # Required: SFTP server hostname
port = 22                           # Optional: SSH port (default: 22)
username = "user"                   # Optional: Username for authentication
password = "password"               # Optional: Password (either password or key_filename required)
key_filename = "/path/to/private_key"  # Optional: Path to private key file
```

#### AWS S3 Client

```toml
[s3]
type = "s3"
url = "s3://my-bucket"              # Optional: S3 URL (alternative to bucket_name)
bucket_name = "my-bucket"           # Optional: S3 bucket name (alternative to url)
region_name = "us-west-2"           # Optional: AWS region
endpoint_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com"  # Optional: Custom S3 endpoint (for S3-compatible services)
aws_access_key_id = "ACCESS_KEY"    # Optional: AWS access key (uses environment/credentials if not specified)
aws_secret_access_key = "SECRET_KEY"  # Optional: AWS secret key (uses environment/credentials if not specified)
```

**Note:** AWS credentials are typically loaded from environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) or `~/.aws/credentials` file. Only specify credentials in the config if needed.

#### Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Client

```toml
[azure]
type = "azure"
url = "mystorageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net"  # Required: Azure storage account URL
filesystem = "myfilesystem"         # Required: Azure filesystem name
connection_string = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;..."  # Optional: Full connection string
account_key = "ACCOUNT_KEY"         # Optional: Storage account key
```

**Note:** Azure authentication typically uses environment variables or Azure CLI login. Only specify `connection_string` or `account_key` if needed for direct authentication.

### Example Configuration File

```toml
# Complete example showing all supported backends
[local]
type = "local"

[my-ftp]
type = "ftp"
url = "ftp://ftp.example.com"
username = "user"
password = "password"
tls = true

[my-sftp]
type = "sftp"
url = "sftp.example.com"
username = "user"
key_filename = "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"

[my-s3]
type = "s3"
url = "s3://my-bucket"
region_name = "us-west-2"

[my-azure]
type = "azure"
url = "mystorageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net"
filesystem = "myfilesystem"
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m ftpc [--config CONFIG_FILE] <remote> [path]
```

- `--config`: Optional path to configuration file (defaults to `~/.ftpcconf.toml`)
- `remote`: Name of the remote connection from your config file
- `path`: Optional starting path (defaults to root '/')

Examples:
```bash
# Connect to defined S3 remote and start at root path
python -m ftpc s3

# Connect to defined FTP remote and start at specific path
python -m ftpc ftp /public/files

# Use a specific config file
python -m ftpc --config ./my-config.toml azure /documents
```
